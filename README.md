This code uses pre-trained AI to detect hands and hand indices. Uses the coordinates of the tip of the thumb and index finger in order to calculate the distance in between them, then determine wheter or not the hand is in a pinch or expanded pinch position. The windows API is used in order to control the audio of your system, the audio increases if the hand is in an expanded pinch position, and vice versa. There is a green bar on the left side of the screen to indicate a percentage out of 100.
